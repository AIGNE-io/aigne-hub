# Blocklet Store Deployment

Deploying AIGNE Hub from the Blocklet Store is the most straightforward and recommended method. This approach leverages the Blocklet Server environment to provide a one-click installation experience, handling dependencies and initial setup automatically. It is the ideal choice for operators who prioritize speed and simplicity.

Before proceeding, ensure you have a running Blocklet Server instance. For detailed requirements, please refer to the [Prerequisites](./deployment-and-installation-prerequisites.md) document.

## Installation Process

The installation is managed through a guided wizard within the Blocklet Server dashboard.

1.  **Navigate to the Blocklet Store**
    Access your Blocklet Server dashboard and open the "Store" section from the navigation menu.

2.  **Search for AIGNE Hub**
    Use the search bar within the store to find the "AIGNE Hub" application.

3.  **Launch the Installation**
    Click the "Launch" button on the AIGNE Hub application page. This will initiate the installation wizard.

4.  **Follow the On-Screen Wizard**
    The wizard will guide you through the necessary configuration steps. You will be prompted to confirm the installation settings. Once confirmed, Blocklet Server will automatically download, install, and start the AIGNE Hub instance.

5.  **Access Your Instance**
    Upon successful installation, you will be redirected to the AIGNE Hub's main dashboard. The instance is now running and ready for configuration.
