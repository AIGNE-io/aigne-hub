# AIGNE Hub

**The Centralized AI Provider for the AIGNE Ecosystem**

_Formerly known as AI Kit, now evolved into AIGNE Hub_

## Overview

AIGNE Hub represents the evolution of our AI Kit project into a comprehensive, centralized AI provider service designed specifically for the AIGNE ecosystem. What began as a simple adapter for various Large Language Model (LLM) backends has grown into a sophisticated platform that serves as the default LLM and AIGC (AI Generated Content) provider for applications built with the AIGNE framework.

This transformation reflects our broader product expansion, which includes AIGNE Studio (our no-code AI tool) and the complete AIGNE framework suite. AIGNE Hub now stands as a core component that seamlessly integrates with all AIGNE products, providing unified AI capabilities across the entire ecosystem.

## What is AIGNE Hub?

AIGNE Hub is a centralized service that manages connections to various LLM and AIGC providers, eliminating the need for individual applications to handle API keys, usage tracking, and billing separately. Built as a [Blocklet](https://blocklet.io) using the AIGNE framework, it provides a single point of access for all your generative AI needs.

### Key Benefits
